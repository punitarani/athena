# Athena

Research at The Speed of Thought.

## Inspiration
The rapid growth of scientific literature has made it challenging for researchers to keep up with the latest developments and ensure the originality of their work. Traditional methods of navigating scholarly information are becoming obsolete, inspiring us to create Athena, a framework that streamlines the literature review process using advanced NLP techniques.

## What it does
Athena assists researchers in various stages of the literature review and research discovery process by employing a team of specialized conversational agents to:

1. Perform intelligent literature search and knowledge discovery
2. Comprehend and summarize research papers in context
3. Identify research gaps and analyze trends
4. Generate and test hypotheses based on existing knowledge
5. Validate claims against empirical evidence from previous research

## How we built it
Athena utilizes a multi-agent architecture with different language models for each agent based on their required capabilities. The agents collaborate by sharing context and memory through long-term and short-term memory systems. The execution pipeline demonstrates the iterative and collaborative nature of the agents, working together to refine research outputs.

Athena's knowledge base combines a vast collection of scientific literature with an embedded bi-directional citation network built using the OpenAlex API, enabling comprehensive analysis of claims and their evolution over time.

## Challenges we ran into
Developing Athena presented challenges in managing context and preventing knowledge hallucinations across agents, mitigating error propagation, dealing with computational constraints, and the current lack of visual comprehension abilities.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We developed a novel framework for AI-assisted research discovery that integrates diverse data sources into a comprehensive knowledge base, enabling key research capabilities like gap analysis, hypothesis testing, and claim validation.

## What we learned
We gained insights into the challenges of designing collaborative multi-agent systems, the importance of robust knowledge management and context tracking, and the potential of large language models in scientific research and discovery.

## What's next for Athena
Future plans include incorporating visual comprehension capabilities, improving hallucination management, implementing inter-agent checks and thought propagation techniques, optimizing performance, and expanding Athena's knowledge base to cover a wider range of scientific domains.
